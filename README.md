# fictional-university-tutorial

Working through a WordPress content developer tutorial.

These are files from a custom developed WordPress theme. (Please note: Activating this theme may cause errors on your server. Please backup the server before installing or activating this theme.)
It can be installed by the following instructions:

1. Copy the mu-plugins folder to sitename/app/public/wp-content
2. Paste the 'fictional-university-tutorial' folder into sitename/app/public/wp-content/themes/
3. Delete the 'mu-plugins' folder from the 'fictional-university-tutorial' folder.
4. With the 'fictional-university-tutorial' folder open in Visual Studio Code, run 'npm install' then 'npm run dev' (or 'npm run devFast' for less optimized results) to bundle the javascript and css files for the website. If you are using a dev environment, the bundled files will be served on localhost:3000 for auto-refresh capabilities.
5. Activate the theme from the WordPress dashboard.
